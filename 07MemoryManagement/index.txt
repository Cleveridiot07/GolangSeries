Here are the key points about memory management in Golang based on the image:

1. Two main functions for memory allocation: new() and make()

2. new():
   - Allocates memory but does not initialize it
   - Returns a memory address
   - Results in zeroed storage (memory is set to zero values)

3. make():
   - Allocates memory and initializes it
   - Returns a memory address
   - Results in non-zeroed storage (memory may contain arbitrary values)

4. Both functions are used for memory allocation, but they differ in initialization and resulting memory state.

5. The choice between new() and make() depends on whether you need initialized memory or not.

6. Understanding these functions is crucial for effective memory management in Go programs.
